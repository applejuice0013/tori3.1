Day 5

The first half of gamer time Tori went diamond mining and got like 150 diamonds. She is insanely good at mining. 

We added the Simply Swords mod, along with patchouli and better combat. Now we can hold down click to swing our swords. There's a bunch of new weapons to craft or to find in chests.

We were in my room this evening because Drew had Maddy over so we played Minecraft in my bed. Very comfy.

After some mining we went to the Twilight Forest again and went to the Dark Forest. We killed the miniboss in 3 out of the 4 mazes surrounding the tower. The miniboss were phantom knights. We went to the tower but couldn't figure out how to get in.

I went on youtube after and looked it up to find out how to enter the tower.

We are kicking so much ass in this minecraft world. I think we should go kill the enderdragon soon so we can get elytra for both of us.

Priority for next gamer time should be diamond armor though.
