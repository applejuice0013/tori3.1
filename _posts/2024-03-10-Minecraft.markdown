Day 1 (starting now)

Today we went into both of the new worlds that we modded into the game. 

In the Twilight Forest we beat Naga (the first boss)

We tried to beat the next boss in the tower thing but couldn't (the Lych I think its called).

Tori got like 70 something diamonds totally legitimately and did not in any way cheat to get them. She is super boss at finding diamonds

I am working on making us the bossest tools, with mending and everything. Currently we have diamond armor that has been lvl 30 enchanted, but I haven't started stacking all of it together yet. 

At the end of the evening we went into the Aether and both died immediately by being launched into the sky. We have yet to do tons of exploring there though.

Moving forward we gotta get a villager super complex going.
