Day 4

I'm gonna be completly honest I don't remember what we did on this day.

Just kidding! I remember now. We spent the first half of the evening finishing up the villager house and stuff like that and then we went back into the Twilight Forest.

In the forest we went to the ice biome. We found a Yeti den and killed the mini boss there, the Alpha Yeti.

Then we climbed up the ice plateau in the center of the winter biome and found a beautiful ice tower. We climbed it, looting every chest we saw, fighting weird snowflake enemies. When we reached the top we found the Ice Queen and totally shit on her. We looted the chest that spawned when she died and then we went home. 

Note: Tori's diamond helmet broke so I made her the Ice mask. We need enchanted mending armor asap!
