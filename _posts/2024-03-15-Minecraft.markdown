Day 2

I'm logging this almost a week after it actually happened so my memory may be a little fuzzy

Tori built an awesome epic villager house and we got 5 librarian villagers with dank enchanted books to trade for. At this moment Tori is working on the upstairs of the house and the exterior

We got the best enchanted diamond pickaxes we could possibly get and I started working on creating OP swords for us as well.

We went back into the Twilight Forest dimension and killed the Lich at the top of the tower, allowing us to access more of the biomes in that dimension and take on harder bosses

What's next? To be determined...
