Day 3

Today Tori finished the outside of the villager house and added a box for us to put zombies in. She also added stair so that the villagers can go up and down in the house. I want to get them to start making babies at some point, maybe even create a villager farm that spawns them so that we can get a bunch more. We'll see how that goes

I finished making the best diamond sword for the both of us so we each have that. 

Near the end of the night we went into the Aether dimension and I figured out that none of our tools work in that dimension unfortunately. We'll have to build up our arsenal from that realm on its own. We'll need to make new pickaxes and swords and stuff with the cool ore we find there.

Since then I also logged in on my own and added the ability to empty the enderman farm so it doesn't fill and then get stuck full of ender pearls
