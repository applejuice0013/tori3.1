Hi Tori

I am still learning how to use this web building software stuff so some of this site may be a little clunky at first. There may be things that are part of like the default template that I don't yet understand how to get rid of (like that dumb subscribe via RSS link down there).

This page is supposed to be formatted like a blog, so there's one singular post down there that you can click the link of. Everything else I add will be in the top right in those separate sub-pages of the website essentially. Maybe I'll fuck around and turn the rest of the blog entries into dated logs of what we do in our Minecraft server on each day, making a new blog post for each MC session.

I hope this turns out less stupid than I think it probably will. I kinda wanna keep updating it over time like a little bit of a journal if you will.
