    <p>I am such a bad boyfriend. You've expressed to me countless times that when I post you it makes you feel loved. 
    It makes you feel like you're my girl and I want everybody to know. It feels like I'm always apologizing for this same thing.
    I really don't know why I'm so bad at it. It didn't cross my mind this afternoon to make a post because I was so stupidly caught up in my day.
    The only way I can think to explain it is that I'm just a private person and I don't like to post much on social media so I don't think about posting.
    I hope that you can forgive me for not making a post on the official day of our 3 year anniversary. I dropped the ball.
    I bet the fact that I didn't post anything kind of ruined your night and made you bummed out at the very least. You seemed to go to bed 
    without saying much to me after you got home from school. I'm just so oblivious sometimes. I don't even know why I'm writing this all out because tomorrow morning
    or at least when we see each other I'm sure we'll have a conversation about it and I'll feel like a butthead and you won't feel good either
    and then I'll promise to be better in the future even though I've probably already said that so many times. Idk. I'm sorry. I love you infinity.</p>
